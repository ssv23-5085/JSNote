# 📝 JSNote – Text Editor using Java Swing

## 📖 Overview
**JSNote** is a lightweight and user-friendly **Text Editor** built entirely using **Core Java and Swing**.  
It provides essential text editing features like **Open, Save, Undo, Redo, Find, Replace**, and even includes **Dark Mode** and **Keyboard Shortcuts** — all in a simple desktop interface.  

This project is part of my **Java learning journey**, designed to strengthen my understanding of **Core Java**, **Data Structures**, and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.
